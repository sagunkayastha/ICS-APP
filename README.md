## Biogass Cook-Stove labelling Software

This labeling system has been developed through parameters provided by the international \n ISO-IWA Tier System and NIBC Standards for Biomass Cookstoves 2016/17.

The stoves need to pass the minimums set by NIBC standards to enter the user acceptance scoring.\n This is a star based and color coded labeling system.

The user aceptance questionnaire and scoring was developed by Centre for Rural Technology, Nepal in coordination with Alternative Energy Promotion Centre(AEPC) with support from The World Bank.
